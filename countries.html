                <p>The United States has one of the worldâ€™s finest university systems, with outstanding programs in virtually all fields.
                    At the undergraduate level, excellent programs exist in traditional disciplines, as well as in professional fields. At
                    the graduate level, students have the opportunity to work directly with some of the finest minds in their field of
                    study, with the chance to become involved with exclusive research and educational opportunities. U.S. degrees are
                    recognized throughout the world for their excellence. Around 80% of the research all over the world is being
                    conducted &amp; funded in USA by various universities &amp; companies in USA. The no of noble laureates from USA is a
                    testimony to it.</p>
                <p>USA has several thousand colleges and universities, boasting at least ten times as many campuses as in any other
                    country. As a result, the higher education system in the U.S. has something for everyone. Some U.S. colleges and
                    universities stress broad educational principles; others emphasize practical, employment-related skills; and still
                    others specialize in the arts, social sciences or technical fields. As a result, students have a variety of options and
                    educational opportunities if they are looking for a particular field.</p>

                        much-talked-about Irish Arts programmes Â and the pedagogically supreme curriculum adopted by almost all
                        campuses of Wales are few of the many reasons for the UKâ€™s status of being the second-most opted for destination
                        by international students.</p>

                        <li><p>The Best you Can Get - UK education is recognised by employers, universities and governments worldwide. The
                            fact that 4 out of the top 6 Universities in the world originate in UK is a testament to their superlative quality of
                            education.</p></li>
                        <li><p>A Haven in Heaven â€“ The UK is an accrued cultural hub with architecture that hearkens back to history and a
                            society that is favourable and supportive to every student and young aspiring professional.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Time is Money â€“ Not only do the programmes in UK are much more concise and time-efficient than others around
                            the world, even their tuition costs and living expenses are truncated due to this fact. Thus, you save the dough and
                            finish your studies before you know.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Cross your Tâ€™s and Dot your Iâ€™s â€“ English is germane to this region of the world so if thereâ€™s any place that can be
                            instrumental in honing your linguistic skills and English proficiency, it is the UK.</p></li>
                        <li><p>A Cultural Kaleidoscope â€“ The UK is home to one of the largest international communities in the world. The
                            number of cultures present in the UK surpass those in any other nation. Hence, it proves to be an incredibly easy
                            environment for an international student to acclimatise with.</p></li>

                    <p>The window for submitting a timely application can differ with the choice of course as well as opted University. Â In
                        a more generic fashion, it can be safely stated thatÂ programmes commencing inÂ the autumn term
                        (September/October) need to be applied to by summer Â (around July/August).</p>
                    <p>This window get smaller for the overseas students as they need to be earlier than anyone else to accommodate
                        sundry formalities and documentation (funding/finance, visa, etc)Â which entails a series of prerequisites for their
                        acceptance as well as admission.</p>
                    <p>As for the acceptance, the response-time of most Universities in the UK ranges from a few weeks to three months.</p>
                    <p>Hence, in the light of this time-frame, it is highly recommended that an international student applies five to six
                        months (in certain cases, ten to eleven months)before the commencement of the course in order to contrive an order
                        of things for further processing. So be an early bird rather than a late snail!</p>
