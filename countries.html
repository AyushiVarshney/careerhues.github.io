                        <li><p>#1 In the World – For the past 9 consecutive years, a United Nations Survey has found Canada to be the best place
                            in the world to live in owing to its high life expectancy, easy access to education and low crime rate. This annually

                            education.</p></li>
                        <li><p>A Haven in Heaven – The UK is an accrued cultural hub with architecture that hearkens back to history and a
                            society that is favourable and supportive to every student and young aspiring professional.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Time is Money – Not only do the programmes in UK are much more concise and time-efficient than others around

                        <li><p>Cross your T’s and Dot your I’s – English is germane to this region of the world so if there’s any place that can be

                        a more generic fashion, it can be safely stated that programmes commencing in the autumn term
                        (September/October) need to be applied to by summer  (around July/August).</p>
                    <p>This window get smaller for the overseas students as they need to be earlier than anyone else to accommodate
                        sundry formalities and documentation (funding/finance, visa, etc) which entails a series of prerequisites for their
                        acceptance as well as admission.</p>
                    <p>As for the acceptance, the response-time of most Universities in the UK ranges from a few weeks to three months.</p>
                    <p>Hence, in the light of this time-frame, it is highly recommended that an international student applies five to six
                        months (in certain cases, ten to eleven months)before the commencement of the course in order to contrive an order
                        of things for further processing. So be an early bird rather than a late snail!</p>
